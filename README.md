# Try-With-Resources

The motivation behind this project was to figure out the
real life usage and implementation of the try-with-resources
language feature within Java. With the adoption of this
feature, developers can more elegantly close their resources
while making their code more ridge. The problem was there
was no way to determine if this feature was ever actually
being implemented in real projects. Our approach to this
was to expand upon a project provided to us in our class
Software Engineering. Our results drew us to believe that
the try-with-resources language feature is not being widely
used. Although it does reduce the lines of code, we could
not find sufficient evidence supporting its widespread use.
